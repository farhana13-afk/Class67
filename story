It had started raining outside, and Scar, the cat, had snuck outside a couple of hours ago. 
Now, Scar was stuck outside, in the rain, with no where to go. 
Scar decided to leave the shade of the mail box that she was using for cover, and sprint across the lawn as fast as she could. 
A couple of seconds later, Scar had reached the front door, soaking wet, and snuck back in through the open door. 
She decided to warm up by the cozy fire and go to sleep.
